# FinalProjectPPOL564
This repository is a workspace for my final project for PPOL546 - Data Science Foundations.

The aim of this project was to use various machine learning methods in an attempt to predict allocation percentages of funds from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to each state from 2006-2019.
